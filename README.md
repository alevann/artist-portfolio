# Artist Portfolio

A simple open-source portfolio template built with pure HTML, CSS, and JS with no external dependencies other than Google's Roboto font.
The website should work on any modern browser/device combination.

You can check out a preview of the portfolio [here][preview].

## Who is this for?

This template has been designed for people who just want to show a few photos and redirect to their socials. 
With that said, it's such a simple project that it can be built upon really easily, by anyone.

## Features

There really isn't a lot to this website, so this list is quite short:

* Links to social media: add, change, and remove socials or shops by simply editing the HTML list
* Carousel with images: add as many images as you want, with or without a title
* Quick and simple to customize: no fancy frameworks were used, anyone can extend this website
* Extrimely lightweight: you can add as many images as you want in any resolution

### Customization

There's very few steps to take to fully customize this page, here's a list you can run through in less than 5 minutes:

1. Change the title and meta description in the HTML
1. Update the links to your socials and shops and optionally add or remove any you don't need
1. Add your images in the HTML and optionally add titles and sub-titles

And you're done! That was quick wasn't it?
